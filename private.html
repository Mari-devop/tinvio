                <p class="tp-privacy__content-text">If your information has been shared with a third party, as described above, or collected on behalf of a third party, then that third party has received their own copy of your data.

                <p class="tp-privacy__content-text">If you wish to not have your personal information shared with third parties for the creation and display of targeted advertisements, you will need to close your account. This action may be possible through the settings within your account or by contacting us at privacy@tinvio.com. We do not recommend that you do this unless you plan to no longer use the Services and will have no need to receive further communications from us or through our system. Even after you opt-out of all communications, we will retain your information in accordance with this Policy, however, we will no longer use it to contact you. However, third parties who have received your information in accordance with this Policy may still use that information to contact you in accordance with their own privacy policies, but they may not use our system to do so.<br /></p>
                <p class="tp-privacy__content-text">If you would like to delete your account with us, you may do so by emailing us at privacy@tinvio.com and specifying which account(s) to delete.</p>

We may block your mobile number, email address and Internet protocol address to prevent further registration.</p>
                <h4 class="tp-privacy__content-title">User content</h4>

                <h4 class="tp-privacy__content-title">Billing and payments</h4>
                <p class="tp-privacy__content-text">Tinvio is free to use. Where future Services are offered on a free trial basis, payment may be required after the free trial period ends.

                <br />
                <p class="tp-privacy__content-text">We are responsible for paying to the relevant Third Party PSPs (as defined below) such fees and charges for your use of third party payment services (“PSP Fees”).

                <br />
                <p class="tp-privacy__content-text">If, in our judgment, your purchase constitutes a high-risk transaction, we will require you to provide us with a copy of your valid government-issued photo identification, and possibly a copy of a recent bank statement for the credit or debit card used for the purchase. We reserve the right to change products and product pricing at any time. We also reserve the right to refuse any order you place with us.
